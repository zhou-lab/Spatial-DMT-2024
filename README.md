# Spatial joint profiling of DNA methylome and transcriptome
### Introduction
This repository aims to share the raw data processing and downstream data analysis & visualization codes used in the Spatial-MT-seq project.

Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) NGS was conducted on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (pair-end, 150-base-pair mode)
